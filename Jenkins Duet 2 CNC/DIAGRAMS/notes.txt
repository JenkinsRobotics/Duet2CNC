	Designing parts 
parts are .5 mm larger in x & y axis , .3mm taller in the z axis


Print out calibration circle and check how much clearence is needed for connecting parts 
		1mm Clearence is acceptable (minimal) (snug fit)
		1.25mm Clearence is acceptable (loose snug fit)
		1.5mm loose fit
		2 mm   (No contact rim)

remove all fillets who's contors are not not in the Normal direction of print 


	Metal Molds  [sand/shell casting]

Sand/shell casting

	100% part (investment molds)
place part into container and pour sand/plaster around it to make a mold
back out filement 
pour in metal

	50% parts (parmanent molds)
using sand/patent form mold around parts
remove pattents
reconnect two molds and pour in metal
