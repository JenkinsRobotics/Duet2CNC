Update Log

7/18/17
	started update log,
	Testing using Octopus model
	1) Model had extensive bulges/bumps at retraction sights
		-cause: determined to be the speed of retraction was to slow causing the printer to pause for a period of time causing the bumps
		- solution: increased retraction speed from 35mm/s to 60 mm/s
	2) Ringing problem
		- Cause: according to information found likey cause is that the acceleration is to high
		- Solution : Edit the EEMROM to lower the acceleration from 1000mm/s^2 to 900mm/s^2

	3) Updated EEMROM 
		- noticed some of the values were less then the valused curently being used on Simplify3D
			changed Retraction from 3mm to 4mm
			change retraction speed from 40mm/s to 60mm/s

		SAVED EEMROM AS 7/18/17
